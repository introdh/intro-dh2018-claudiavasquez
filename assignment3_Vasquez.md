Place and Space Storymap

Using a google spreadsheet I was able to record my activities and locations by the hour over the course of a week. To do this I used a premade template with five rows labeled hour, activity, location, latitude, and longitude. Each column was filled with the corresponding information, such as 2018-11-05 9:00 which shows the date- November 5, 2018- and the time- nine oâ€™clock in the morning. After the data for the week was completely filled out, I saved the spreadsheet as a cvs file and uploaded it onto ArcGIS Online, a website that allows users to customize a map. From there I was able to add layers to the map including a heat map which shows which areas I visited the most frequently throughout the week. I wanted my storymap to document both my activities throughout the week and the spaces I enjoy the most on campus. I really enjoyed using storymap and ArcGIS because of their abilities to "integrate, analyze, and make visual a vast array of data from different formats, all by virtue of their shared geography," (Bodenhamer, SSBMD, 2013). I support Bodenham's outlook on GIS software as a tool to "see, experience, and understand human behavior in all its complexity." Crampton makes another good point stating that maps "seem to be nothing at all, just mere bits of fluff in the air," (Crampton, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010). Maps only mean something if people take meaning from them. That was the struggle of this project- creating meaning from a mapped agenda. However, the various features of these resources really enabled me to bring my schedule to life. Having the ability to use features like the heat map and the streetview allowed me to show a location as a personal space instead of a neutral place. I used pictures that I have taken and edited throughout the semester to show how I view places around campus. Each of the places I included are spaces that have become part of my new life here at the University of Richmond. One flaw I noticed with this project was that it was difficult to customize the map in ArcGIS. There are only so many features available and not many ways to personalize your project. Though GIS mapping is by no means a perfect method, it is effective in visualizing a place and showing trends.
